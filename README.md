# Prime-Number-Identifier
The program generates a random number up to 100 and asks the user if it prime or not. Once the program gets the user input it will tell the user if he/she is right or wrong.

The program uses different conditions in if statements to check the user's input. It also uses an if statement to check whether the randomly generated number is prime or not by using a modulo.
